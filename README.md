The goal of the project - automate the process for adding words to the learning app to check English words knowledge for certain official levels.

The first part - parsing official site for english words for every level from A1 to C2.

Second part - translate words and add them to the profile. Important to mention that API is NOT public, so some work was related to understanding how connection works using public forums.
